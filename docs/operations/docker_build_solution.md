# Docker Build Issue Solution Summary
# Dockerビルド問題解決策まとめ
# Docker构建问题解决方案总结

## Problem Description
## 問題の説明
## 问题描述

When building the Docker image, we encountered an issue where the `tokenizers` library required a Rust compiler, causing the build to fail.

## Root Cause Analysis
## 原因分析
## 原因分析

1. The `tokenizers` library was introduced as an indirect dependency of `transformers` and `farm-haystack`
2. These libraries require a Rust compiler to build from source
3. The Docker container does not have a Rust compiler installed by default

## Solution
## 解決策
## 解决方案

### Dependency Analysis
### 依存関係の分析
### 依赖分析

We discovered that the `tokenizers` library was introduced as an indirect dependency of `transformers` and `farm-haystack`, which require a Rust compiler to build.

### Usage Confirmation
### 使用状況の確認
### 使用确认

Through code analysis, we confirmed that the project primarily uses AWS Bedrock services and doesn't need to run models locally, so it doesn't require the `transformers` and `farm-haystack` libraries.

### Dependency Modification
### 依存関係の修正
### 依赖修改

We removed the `transformers` and `farm-haystack` libraries from `requirements.txt`, keeping only the dependencies that the project actually needs:

```diff
  boto3>=1.37.0
  langchain==0.0.267
- farm-haystack==1.15.0
- transformers==4.25.1
  requests>=2.27.1
  pydantic>=1.9.0,<2.0.0
```

### Dockerfile Simplification
### Dockerfileの簡素化
### Dockerfile简化

We removed the configuration added for installing the Rust compiler, making the Dockerfile more concise:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
# Install the latest version of boto3 and botocore
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade boto3 botocore

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=production

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Start application
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

## Results
## 結果
## 结果

1. Successfully built the Docker image without needing to install the Rust compiler
2. Reduced the Docker image size
3. Simplified the build process and improved build speed
4. Removed unnecessary dependencies, making the project more lightweight

## Conclusion
## 結論
## 结论

Since the project primarily uses AWS Bedrock services rather than local models, we could safely remove the `transformers` and `farm-haystack` libraries, thereby avoiding the need for a Rust compiler. This approach not only solved the build issue but also optimized the entire project's dependency structure.
